Here's a summary of The Economist's November 29th, 2025 issue, highlighting the three biggest stories and other notable topics:

**Issue Date:** November 29th, 2025

This issue is dominated by major geopolitical shifts, particularly concerning China's technological rise and the ongoing diplomatic efforts around the Ukraine war. Domestically, in the United States, former President Donald Trump's political and legal standing remains a central focus.

### The 3 Biggest Stories:

1.  **China's Ascendant Tech Innovation & Global Dominance:** The cover story highlights China's rapid progress in frontier technologies like autonomous vehicles and new drugs. Driven by a deep talent pool, vast manufacturing base, and surprisingly nimble regulators, Chinese companies are becoming hypercompetitive export champions, even outpacing American counterparts in areas like open-source AI models. The issue cautions Western economies against "knee-jerk protectionism" and urges them to rethink their own innovation strategies to compete effectively.
2.  **Shifting Landscape of the Russia-Ukraine War & Peace Talks:** Diplomatic efforts are intensifying around a controversial 28-point peace proposal, with President Trump reporting "tremendous progress" and Ukraine's President Zelensky open to discussing "sensitive issues" including territorial concessions. The accompanying editorial warns against an "unjust peace" that could hamper Ukraine's defense, urging Europe to provide generous, multi-year financial commitments. Meanwhile, Ukraine continues drone strikes on Russian targets, and Russia pounds Kyiv. The IMF also approved an $8.2bn funding program for Ukraine.
3.  **Donald Trump's Consolidated Power and Legal Resilience:** President Trump experienced a significant boost to his political standing with the dismissal of a racketeering case in Georgia, and three other criminal cases against him having been dismissed or put aside since his return to office. He accepted an invitation to visit Beijing in April to discuss trade and global security and vowed a crackdown on "unvetted immigration" following a shooting near the White House. The issue also notes Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation from Congress after a public feud with Trump over the Epstein files.

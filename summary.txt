This issue of *The World Ahead 2026* is largely defined by the **pervasive influence of Donald Trump**, whose norm-shattering approach continues to reshape global affairs, American democracy, and the world economy. The publication explores ten key trends for the coming year, with deeper dives into geopolitics, major global powers, and economic forecasts.

Here are the 3 biggest stories highlighted:

1.  **Donald Trump's Enduring and Reshaping Influence:** 2026 is expected to remain "Donald Trump’s world," with his transactional, instinct-driven approach dictating US domestic policy and global geopolitics. This includes America's 250th anniversary amidst deeply divided narratives, the November midterm elections potentially offering checks on his power, continued rule by bullying and executive orders, and the further decay of the old global rules-based order, replaced by ad-hoc "coalitions of the willing." His influence is seen in everything from trade to defence spending and diplomacy, with a focus on a "Sopranos"-style leadership that brought both successes (Gaza ceasefire, increased NATO defence budgets) and failures (alienating India and Brazil, being outmaneuvered by China).
2.  **China's Strategic Offensive in a Changing Geopolitical Landscape:** Following a successful 2025 where it insulated its economy from trade wars and leveraged Trump's "America First" policy to boost global influence, China faces the temptation for aggressive assertion in 2026. This includes risks of overreach in trade (swamping global markets with exports), Taiwan (a potential "grey-zone" campaign against the island due to perceived American ambivalence), and proposing new Chinese-led global rules. The article warns against hubris, suggesting China's best strategy is to let Trump continue dismantling the Western-led system while it cautiously compounds its advantage.
3.  **Global Economic Volatility and the Unfolding Impact of AI:** The world economy is bracing for "mediocre growth" and, in America, "too much inflation." Despite some resilience, Trump's tariffs are expected to dampen global growth, and rising government deficits in rich countries risk a bond-market crisis. The replacement of Jerome Powell as Fed chair in May is a critical economic event, with fears of politicizing the Federal Reserve. Concurrently, there are "Concerns over AI," with rampant infrastructure spending potentially masking economic weakness. The issue questions if the AI "bubble" will burst and highlights deepening worries about AI's impact on jobs, particularly for graduates, as its true societal and economic effects become more apparent.

Other notable topics include:

*   **Problems for Europe:** The continent faces a difficult balancing act of increasing defence spending (to keep America engaged), boosting economic growth, dealing with large deficits (which could fuel hard-right parties), and maintaining its advocacy for free trade and green policies.
*   **Ongoing Global Conflicts:** While a fragile peace in Gaza is hoped for, conflicts are expected to grind on in Ukraine (where Russia has "no plan for winning" but continues to fight, storing up a "terrible reckoning"), Sudan, and Myanmar. "Grey-zone" provocations from Russia and China will test US alliances, with rising tensions in the Arctic, orbit, seafloor, and cyberspace.
*   **A Mixed Climate Picture:** Limiting warming to 1.5°C is deemed "off the table," and Trump remains hostile to renewables. However, global emissions have likely peaked, clean technology is booming in the global south, and many firms will quietly meet or exceed their climate targets to avoid Trump's ire. Geothermal energy is singled out as worth watching.
*   **Ethical Debates in Sports and Medicine:** The football World Cup in North America faces strains due to host country relations, while the controversial "Enhanced Games" (allowing performance-enhancing drugs) raise ethical questions about "cheating vs. different." This debate extends to the wider public with the advent of "better, cheaper GLP-1 weight-loss drugs" like Ozempic, prompting questions about the ethics of widespread performance enhancement.
*   **Cultural Reflections:** Homer’s "Odyssey" is presented as offering lessons for navigating the storm-tossed times of 2026.
